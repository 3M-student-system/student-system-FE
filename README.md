<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## :bulb: About The Project

 This is a CRUD-based Demo system, whose main purpose was to practice git version control as we were working in a team of 3 people on this project. 
 The system tracks the time and when the time comes when the course starts the forms to register becomes available for students. It is made that if a student wants to register for the course must enter the password which is checked in Back-End by some kind of algorithm that depends on current date.
 
### :hammer: Built With

- Used React.js with function components, hooks, context.
- Node.js express for Back-End;
- MySQL Database;
- Styled-Components for styling.

Please note that the Back-End NodeJS code is in another repo https://github.com/3M-student-system/student-system-BE
